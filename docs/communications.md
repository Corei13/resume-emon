# Communcations

To make sure you thrive in your roles, we have a very high expectations for proactive communications. This is what we expect during the qualifier (and will expect when you work with us),

## Daily communications

### Start of the day update

- share a plan for the day, with breakdown and estimate
- this practice teaches you to plan ahead and improves your skill of breaking down a large problem into managable small chunks
- each subtask should be 1 to 2 hours, if it is more - that means you can break down further
- we take this very seriously, and consider this as important (if not more) than writing code itself.
- so even if it takes like 30 minutes initially, that is totally fine and take the time to plan, breakdown and estimate -- it will save everyone hours later
- we are all engineers ourselves, and know that an estimate is an estimate -- it's totally expected that things might take longer (or shorter) than the estimate, specially in the beginning, and you'll get better at estimating over time

### Mid day updates (2x)

- your progress so far since last estimate -- share screenshots if you made significant changes to UI (everyone loves screenshots!)
- if there is any change in plan or estimate (which is completely fine and expected)
- any learning, interesting findings, challenges that were solved / are being solved
- and assumption or decision that you made but were not sure of

### End of the day update

- summary for the day
- any questions/clarifications that would be helpful to get resolved before next day
- **(most important)** a Loom recording (2 - 3 minutes max) where
  - you demo what you built on the day
  - you describe what you built and show us around (in english)
  - (optionally) show us any interesting / challenging pieces of code or any major refactor you did on the day

Note that, the practice of writing updates is not just for us, it's also for you to become a great engineer over time. Engineering is only 10% coding - the rest 90% is how you see the bigger picture, how good you are at planning, breaking problems down, articulating your thoughts for your teammates.

Let me share some examples from other engineers,

### Purpose of the recordings

Your recordings will be your greatest assets when we try to place you at a great company.

No one has time to review your resume or 100s of lines of code. But everyone has time to watch a 2-3 minute video.

Take this seriously. Don't just record a video just because you have to. Share a recording that makes you stand out.

We created a [separate doc](/docs/recording.md) to help you with this.
