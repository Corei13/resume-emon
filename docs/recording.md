# How to record great videos

Here are some tips to help you record great videos:

- [show your face](#show-your-face)
- [show more that you tell](#show-more-than-you-tell)
- [prepare a script](#prepare-a-script)
- [watch your recordings](#watch-your-recordings)
- [enjoy yourself](#enjoy-yourself)

## Show your face

Put a face to your name. Everyone loves seeing a face. It makes you more human and relatable.

At the same time, make sure you are in a well lit place with clean background.

## Show more than you tell

Don't just tell me what you did -- also show me why and how you did them. Give more context!

Imagine that you are making that recording for someone (say, a founder), who doesn't have any idea about yourself, or about the project or what happened in the project previously.

Your looms should still be able to give them enough idea about what you are describing in that video.

For example, image you are saying

> today, my task is to use jotai to replace react context

When I listen to this, I might have no idea what jotai is, why we want to replace context with jotai and what are the benefits of it.

Instead, you could say something like,

> Today, I used a library called jotai, which is a state management library for react that makes it easier to reduce unnecessary re-renders with complex applications. Previously, I was using react context, and today I migrated them using jotai atoms, ...

That way I can understand why you are doing this, how this fits into the bigger picture and what are the benefits of it.

Note that, you don't have to get into too much details eiher (which is also negative, because we should keep the recordings short) -- it's more about delivering as much context in shortest time possible.

## Prepare a script

While you don't have to exactly memorize what to say beforehand (don't do this actually! doing this will make you sound robotic and unnatural like zuckerberg -- which can be even worse!), try to have some script, preferably a few key points that you'd like to go through in that order.

You delivery will be much fluent as a result.

## Watch your recordings

After recording a loom, watch the video yourself and ask yourself if some random founder who would watch that recording will be able to understand what you are talking about.

One way to verify this, is to watch the auto-generated subtitles in loom video player and see if it can properly recognize the words that you are saying.

If it misses a lot of words, that means you are not speaking clearly enough. Pay attention to your pronunciation, background noise, microphone volume, etc and record again.

## Be conversational

Don't simply record a video with boring minimal updates. This will give others the signal that you are not interested in engaging with them.

Speak like you are talking to a friend.

By sharing more than what is strictly necessary, you appear friendlier and this also gives you a chance to make better impression by sharing your insights, learning and thoughts about what you are working on, which challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

Example 1: Instead of saying "I fixed a bug", you could say,

> I fixed a bug that was causing the app to crash when user clicks on this button (show in video). I was able to fix it after trying x, y and z. x and y didn't work, but z did. I spent quite some time figuring out why y didn't work, but I was able to figure it out after reading this article which I found very interesting -- I am going to share this article in slack.

Example 2: If you are sharing something incomplete, also share what you are planning to do next.

> I am using dummy data hardcoded in here (switch to code) and using them to build the UI first, so it won't work it dynamic data for now. I will hook it up with the backend tomorrow.

> I haven't yet made the typography, avatar size, spacing et cetra exactly according to figma, I will do that tomorrow. Also, the messages only support plain text for now, I will add support for images and other rich content tomorrow as well.

^ mentioning what things are incomplete ensures others in the team that **you are on top of things** and take care of them, so they don't have to provide feedback on them for now.

## Enjoy yourself

This is also related to the above two points -- but it helps a LOT if you appear like someone who is having fun and enjoying himself in the recordings.

Trust me, I might not look like one, but I am also a very introverted person like you -- and so are most of the engineers I know of.

But like everything else, this is simply a skill you'll be able to learn and appreciate. In the meantime,

1. speak louder
2. crack a few smiles now and then and most importantly
3. show your face!
