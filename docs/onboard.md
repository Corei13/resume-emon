# Purpose

I want to share a bit more on what we look for during the qualifier so you have higher likelihood of success!

The goal of the qualifier is two-fold.

1. To help you stand out from millions other engineers to startup founders
2. To prepare you for the actual high-growth roles so you can thrive

The reasons our engineers can stand out and thrive on their roles and end up charging 5-10X higher than rest of the engineers are following,

1. They have exposure to the latest technologies and knows best practices
2. They can learn blazingly fast and knows how to work with new things that they never used before
3. **(most importantly)** They are miles ahead in communications compare to others.
   - **This is the defining traits of re:cruit engineers.** It's fairly simple to learn 1 and 2, but most engineers fail to understand the value of great communications and hence fail to be good at it.

During the project, you will build a complex project all by yourself using latest technologies and best practices, which will give you the confidence to talk about them when you will talk to founders.

After the project, we will publish the app live and you'll be able to showcase this too.

Additionally, you will also create daily Loom recordings and a final demo which will also showcase your ability to express yourself and gives founders confidence in your ability to communicate and articulate your thoughts.

# What we look for

1. **Attention to details**

   Go through all the docs very carefully

   - [communication.md](/docs/communications.md)
   - [development.md](/docs/development.md)
   - [recording.md](/docs/recording.md)

   We understand that there are a lot of information to take in and we expect you to go through everything carefully, take notes and ask questions if anything is not clear.

2. **Communications**

   As mentioned above, this is the most important trait we look for.

   We will be looking for your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly and concisely. We will also be looking for your ability to ask questions and clarify your thoughts.
